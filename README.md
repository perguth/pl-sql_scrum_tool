# PL/SQL-SCRUM-Tool

This tool operates on the database only. Tech exploration/demonstration. Not actually usable.

## Installation

Open a `Command Window` or `SQL*Plus`. Copy and paste the contents of `concat.pls`.

For first steps take a look into `test_functionality.sql`.

## Recompiling

You need to have `npm`, `grunt-cli` installed. Install all dependencies
within the folder with the command `npm install` and then recreate `concat.pls` by running `./concat.sh`.
