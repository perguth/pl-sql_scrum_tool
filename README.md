# PL/SQL-SCRUM-Tool

This tool operates on the database only. Tech exploration/demonstration. Not actually usable.

## Installation

Open a `Command Window` or `SQL*Plus`. Copy and paste the contents of `concat.pls`.

For first steps take a look into `test_functionality.sql`.

## Recompiling `concat.pls`

You need to have `npm`, `grunt-cli` installed. Maybe you need to install `npm install`.

Recreate `concat.pls` from all the `*.pls` files by running `./concat.sh`.
